## Functionality

- autoencoder training
- get postfilter to work on spectral subtraction
- set power_scale default to 'power_to_db'?
- functions to use librosa or not to perform tasks (librosa doesn't work on notebooks.ai for example)
- measure level of snr
- measure quality of filtering/speech enhancement
- measure signal similarity
- source separation
- gender switch
- text to speech
- speech to text

## Presentation

- blog post on each set of functionalities
- presentation of examples
- get documentation online

## Testing

- expand test cases

## Organization

- reorganize based on use... how import statement should work
- make sample_rate, samprate, samplingrate, sr namespace consistent
- make features/feature_type namespace consistent
- use keyword arguments for librosa and scipy?

PySoundTool v0.1.0a2
====================  

Welcome to the docs!
--------------------

PySoundTool is a research based Python package_ for exploring and experimenting with sound and deep learning. 

Those who might find this useful: 

* speech and sound enthusiasts
* digital signal processing / mathematics / physics / acoustics enthusiasts
* deep learning enthusiasts
* researchers
* linguists
* psycholinguists

The main goal of PySoundTool is to provide the code and functionality with more context via visualization, research, and mathematics. Most of the resources used to build the functionality stems from publicly available research and datasets.

As it covers quite a large range, from audio file conversion to implementation of trained neural networks, the purpose of PySoundTool is not to be the perfect implementation of all functions (although that is also a goal :P ), but rather a peak into how they *can* be implemented, hopefully offering people a foundation for trying out different ways of implementation (feature extraction, building neural networks, etc.).

This project is still in the beginning stages and has a lot of room for growth, especially with contributers having a background / knowlege in data science, computer science, machine and deep learning, physics, acoustics, or dsp. Contributers from other backgrounds are also welcome! If you'd like PySoundTool to do something it doesn't, try making it or create an issue.

## Speech Sample Data

These are 20 audio files from the IEEE Corpus, collected from the 
accompanying CD of the book Speech Enhancement: Theory and Practice, 
Second Edition 2nd Edition, by Philipos C. Loizou.

### Original IEEE Corpus readme.txt:

This folder contains 720 sentences from the IEEE corpus [1] produced by a 
male  speaker. The sentences (*.wav files) were sampled at 25 kHz (see 
Appendix C for more details).

This folder also contains phonetic transciption files (with extension *.phn)
for all 720 sentences. The .phn files contain the beginning and end samples
of voiced (labeled as 'v') and unvoiced segments (labeled as 'uv') in each 
sentence (initial and ending silence is marked as 'sil'). The voiced/
unvoiced decisions were made initially by an F0 detector taken from the 
STRAIGHT algorithm [2], and then manually corrected using spectrographic and
time-waveform displays.
